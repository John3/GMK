GAME MECHANICS KIT

The first part of this guide will help Torque 3d engine programmers to install Game Mechanics Kit (GMK) into an existing Torque based project. 
The second part covers the basics of working with game objectsâ€™ templates for use with GMK Editor.

Torque3D v2 + GMK + Bullet

I merge the code and fix minor bugs. If someone want to play and test this product, here is the link!

You can download the executable from here: https://github.com/John3/T3D_GMK_BULLET/releases

As you can see from the release note, this are the versions used:

- Torque3D v2.0
- Game Mechanics Kit (GMK) v1.2.13
- Bullet Physics v2.78 release 2383

The source code is in here: https://github.com/John3/T3D_GMK_BULLET

I documented some issues: https://github.com/John3/T3D_GMK_BULLET/issues BTW It is not from the code merge.... I think is from the product itself.

As a note aside I manage to merge and compile GMK and GuideBot but have some important bugs from the TS side that I need to manage. (I think GuideBot is unfinished)
